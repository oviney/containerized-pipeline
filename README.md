# Dockerizing Jenkins - Declarative Build Pipeline With SonarQube Analysis
Dockerizing Jenkins, learn to run Jenkins on Docker, and automate plugin installation, Java and Maven tool configuration, and more.

# Scope of Tutorial
In this tutorial, I am going to demonstrate:

* Running Jenkins on Docker.
* Automation of Jenkins plugin installation on Docker.
* Configuring Java and Maven tools on Jenkins, first manually and then via the Groovy scripts.
* Automating the above step with Docker.
* Running SonarQube on Docker.
* Setting up a Java Maven pipeline with unit tests, test coverage, and SonarQube analysis steps.

# Let's get started
This will be a hands on tutorial, so be ready to get your hands dirty.  By the end, you should be able to run the pipeline on a fully automated Jenkins Docker container.
