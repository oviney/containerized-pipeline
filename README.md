# Dockerizing Jenkins - Declarative Build Pipeline With SonarQube Analysis
Dockerizing Jenkins, learn to run Jenkins on Docker, and automate plugin installation, Java and Maven tool configuration, and more.

# Scope of Tutorial
In this tutorial, I am going to demonstrate:

* Running Jenkins on Docker.
* Automation of Jenkins plugin installation on Docker.
* Configuring Java and Maven tools on Jenkins, first manually and then via the Groovy scripts.
* Automating the above step with Docker.
* Running SonarQube on Docker.
* Setting up a Java Maven pipeline with unit tests, test coverage, and SonarQube analysis steps.

# Let's get started
This will be a hands on tutorial, so be ready to get your hands dirty.  By the end, you should be able to run the pipeline on a fully automated Jenkins Docker container.

As you may already know, with Jenkins 2, you can actually have your build pipeline right within your Java project, so you can actually use your own Maven Java project in order to follow the steps in this article as long as it is hosted on a Git repository.

Everything obviously will be running on Docker, as it is the easiest way of deploying and running them.

So, let’s see how to run Jenkins on Docker:
